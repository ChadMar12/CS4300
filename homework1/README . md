Homework 1 consists of 7 tasks with basic test cases to demonstrate basic and advanced Python techniques and explore DevEdu. Below are the prompts for each Task. 

**Task1:**
Write a Python script that prints "Hello, World!" on the
console. Set up a pytest test case that verifies the output of your script. - Docs.

**Task2:**
Demonstrate the use of various data types, including integers,
floating-point numbers, strings, and boolean. Implement a Python using pytest to test case for each
data type, ensuring that the scriptâ€™s behavior matches the expected outcomes.

**Task3:**
Create an if statement to check if a given number is positive,
negative, or zero. Implement a for loop to print the first 10 prime numbers (you may need to
research how to calculate prime numbers). Create a while loop to find the sum of all numbers from
1 to 100. Write pytest test cases to verify the correctness of your code for each control structure.

**Task4:**
Duck typing is the functionality of a language where "if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck,
you might as well treat it like a duck." This is quite common in interpreted languages. Create a
new file named task4.py that calculates the final price of a product after applying a given discount
percentage inside of a function named calculate_discount. The function should accept any numeric
type for price and discount. Write pytest test cases to test the calculate_discount function with
various types (integers, floats) for price and discount.

**Task5:**
Create a list of your favorite books, including book
titles and authors. Use list slicing to print the first three books in the list. Create a dictionary that
represents a basic student database, including student names and their corresponding student IDs.
Implement pytest test cases to verify the correctness of your code for each data structure.

**Task6:**
Write a program inside task6.py of that reads task6_read_me.txt and counts the number
of words in it. Include pytest test cases that verify the word count for each text file.

**Task7:**
Use pip package manager to add a Python package of your choice to your project (e.g., requests,
numpy, matplotlib). Create a new file named task7.py and write a Python script that demonstrates
how to use the chosen package to perform a specific task or function. Implement pytest test cases
to verify the correctness of your code when using the package.
